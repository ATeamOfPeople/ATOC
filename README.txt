A Team of Crawl
	by A Team of People

This is a pre-alpha roguelike. very very pre alpha. it needs work.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Defense? Power? What lol?

	Power is the direct damage that one monster does to another (the 
player included), and the direct damage is taken off the monster's HP.
Defense is like health that doesnt go away. It takes a static number off
every attack. For example, if a Troll would to hit the Player, the Troll
would deal 4 damage to the Player, but the Player would only take 2 DMG
becase the Player's Defence blocks 2 Power. Not a very original system,
but it will do for now.

Items:
	Healing Potion:
		The viscous, maroon liquid will heal the user for 3-6
	HP. It is very common, and is foud all over the dungeon.

	Roulette:
		This strange contraption has three syringes strapped
 	around a rod, where one syringe always points out of the barrel
	of the syringe gun. The user will pick one syringe at random, 
	and will either be healed for their full health, or will take
	2 DMG. It is a rare item, but you will most likely come across
	a few in your trek throught the dungeon.

	Scroll of Lightning:
		A strange scroll covered in bright blue glyphs seems to
	crackle with static electricity. The user will read the scroll,
	the scroll will spontaneously crumble to dust, and the closest 
	monster will be struck with lightning out of thin air! The
	target will take 20 DMG.

	Scroll of Confusion:
		This peice of paper is gibberish, it is completely 
	incomprehensible, and you have seen no language like it before.
	When you read it, it will turn into a puff of purple smoke, and
	will graciously let the closest monster borrow a chromasome for 
	10 turns.
